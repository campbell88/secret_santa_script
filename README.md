Edit the participants dict with your list of names, their email addresses and previous secret santas. Also a good idea to add partners/spouses to previous_secret_santa list!!

Add your organizer email info to the script as well.

If you have a gmail like me, you'll need to create a gmail app password. Current support link to do this can be found here https://support.google.com/mail/answer/185833?hl=en

To run the script, open your terminal and in the command line type python3 secret_santa.py

And that's it!
